      "India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has urged the country’s armed forces to analyse the ongoing conflicts between Israel-Hamas, Russia-Ukraine, and the current state of affairs in Bangladesh to prepare India for the “unexpected”.\n",
      "He made the remarks on Thursday during a joint commanders’ conference in India’s Lucknow, according to the Indian newspaper The Telegraph.\n",
      "Singh underscored the need for a thorough analysis in light of the recent circumstances in the India-China border and neighbouring countries “which are posing a challenge to peace and stability in the region”.\n",
      "He also emphasised on a coordinated and proportionate response to provocation for any challenges India may face during future wars.\n",
      "“Despite global volatility, India is enjoying a rare peace dividend and it is developing peacefully. However, due to the increasing number of challenges, we need to remain alert,” he was quoted as telling the commanders.\n",
      "“We need to focus on our present, keep an eye on the activities happening around us at present, and focus on being future-oriented.\n",
      "“For this, we should have a strong and robust national security component. We should have a fail-proof deterrence,” Singh was quoted saying.\n",
      "He also highlighted the significance of using artificial intelligence to develop electronic and space warfare.\n",
      "“These components do not participate in any conflict or war directly. Their indirect participation is deciding the course of warfare to a great extent,” he added.\n",
      "While referring to India as a ‘peace-loving’ nation, he stressed that the Indian armed forces need to be ready for war to “preserve peace”.\n",

      "The government, born from a student-led popular uprising, believes there is no room for rehabilitation until justice is served, he said after an advisory council meeting on Thursday.\n",
      "While discussing the prosecution of the Awami League, he mentioned the absence of specific laws for party-level trials and said the law ministry is working to ensure their prosecution for crimes against humanity.\n",
      "“The question of whether a fascist political party and its allies, who had established fascism in Bangladesh, should return to politics will be left to the people until their full trial is completed,\" he said.\n",
      "\"We are considering how to implement measures against their public activities, but there is no final decision yet. However, we will strongly discourage such activities,\" he added.\n",
      "When asked about the absence of laws to prosecute political parties, he said: \"No decision has been made regarding the trial of any party. The matter is under the law ministry, which will soon present a clear plan.\"\n",

      "Ganabhaban was the palatial residence of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, located on the northern side of parliament building.\n",
      "On Aug 5, Hasina fled to India in the face of a mass uprising. Later, the building was looted by agitated protesters.\n",

      "Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s daughters Hasina and Sheikh Rehana had been staying there following the “Father of the Nation Security of Family Members Act, 2009 (Act No. 63 of 2009)\".\n",
      "After being sworn in as prime minister in 2009, Hasina moved into the Ganabhaban with her family in 2010.\n",
      "She was the only prime minister to have lived in the Ganabhaban. It was initially built as the office of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during his tenure.\n",
      "While speaking to reporters, the sports advisor also said although Ganabhaban’s ‘Gana’ means ‘people,’ the building could never become the ‘peoples building’ like the name suggests.\n",
      "“The people of this country, the students, have won it [Ganabhaban] through a coup d'état. The building will be open to the public.\"\n",
      "\"Ganabhaban will be established as the 'July Revolution Memorial Museum' to preserve the memory of the martyrs and all the injustices committed by the previous fascist government.\n",
      "\"The work will start very soon. It [Ganabhaban] will be kept in the same condition as it has been since the victory. A museum will be set up inside so that the memory of the coup is preserved,” he added.\n",
      "On Aug 29, the interim government decided to scrap the law that ensures the additional security for the family members of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman considering it a ‘discriminatory policy.’\n",
      "The \"Father of the Nation Security of Family Members Act, 2009 (Act No. 63 of 2009)\" was passed after the Awami League formed the government in the ninth general election following a landslide victory.\n",
      "Under the law, a special security facility was ensured for the living members of the Father of the Nation’s family.\n",
      "The law had provisions for safe residence and other necessary benefits for each family member. A gazette was issued in May 2015 to provide special security and facilities as per the law.\n",
      "Earlier in 2001, the Awami League government passed the \"Father of the Nation Security of Family Members Act-2001” just before they stepped down. But the BNP-led Four Party Alliance government nullified the act during the eighth parliament.\n",

      "Battery-powered rickshaws and easy bikes, banned from Dhaka’s main roads, have defied restrictions over the past few days.\n",
      "Since Aug 5, these vehicles have been dominating main roads, contributing to traffic disarray with their erratic movements and use of wrong lanes.\n",
      "Drivers and passengers of other vehicles, as well as police officers, have reported increasing concerns about the disorder caused by these three-wheeled vehicles.\n",
      "During a recent visit to areas like Mirpur, Dhanmondi, Shyamoli, Mohakhali, and Badda, numerous battery-operated rickshaws and easy bikes were operating on every major road.\n",
      "These rickshaws often cut in front of faster vehicles and navigate turns unpredictably, causing confusion and increasing risks on the roads.\n",
      "Manjur Hossain, a battery-operated rickshaw-puller from Agargaon, said: “We would earlier avoid main roads during the day, but now with no police presence, we operate everywhere.”\n",
      "“Now, police don’t stop us like they used to. This is why we even take trips on major roads now. We know it’s not safe to go alongside large vehicles on big roads.”\n",
      "“But on main roads, we can get longer trips and earn a bit more,” he added.\n",
      "Another rickshaw-puller, Humayun Kabir from Badda, said: “If CNG drivers can use the main roads, why can not we? They drive engine vehicles, and so do we.”\n",
      "Nazmul Hossain, a CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver, told bdnews24.com that the traffic police have become less active since Aug 5, allowing battery-powered rickshaws to operate freely.\n",
      "“Police don’t enforce the rules like they used to, so these rickshaws are all over the main roads now. They drive recklessly, which only adds to the traffic congestion,” he said.\n",
      "Another CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver, Ahmed Ali, told bdnews24.com: “They drive very fast and make sudden turns without signalling.”\n",
      "“It’s very difficult for drivers behind them to anticipate their movements, increasing the risk of accidents,” he explained.\n",
      "Bulbul Ahmed, a resident of Mirpur, said: “At one time, battery-operated rickshaws were fined and dumped for running on the main road. Now, these practices have stopped.”\n",
      "“The lack of traffic police makes it difficult to control their movement.”\n",
      "Mohammadpur resident Alif Khan told bdnews24.com the presence of battery-operated rickshaws on Dhaka's main roads is extremely dangerous.\n",
      "Alif Khan from Mohammadpur described the situation as dangerous due to the absence of proper indicators on rickshaws, which makes it hard for other drivers to anticipate their movements.\n",
      "“These rickshaws move at speeds of 30 to 35 kilometres per hour, causing other vehicles to slow down and contributing to traffic jams,” he said.\n",
      "A traffic policeman on duty in Shyamoli told bdnews24.com:\"Currently, no one listens to anyone, and the situation is chaotic everywhere. Auto-rickshaws have taken over the streets, driving recklessly. “\n",
      "“Our force is also reduced, so we can't enforce the rules or take action against them. It's not just this road; there is no road in Dhaka where these rickshaws aren't present.\"\n",
      "Khalequzzaman Lipon, central convenor of the Rickshaw, Battery Rickshaw, Van, and Easy Bike Sangram Parishad told bdnews24.com that their organisation has advised drivers to avoid main roads.\n",
      "However, he urged the traffic police to be more active.\n",
      "\"Our directive was to operate only on roads other than the main ones. We have already informed various areas and sent letters through our associations,” said Lipon.\n",
      "“However, the traffic police are not enforcing any restrictions on the roads, leading to this indiscipline,” he added.\n",
      "Kazi Md Saifun Newaz, an assistant professor at Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology, or BUET, told bdnews24.com that rickshaws are a popular mode of transport for Dhaka residents, both for commuting to work and other locations.\n",
      "However, due to the poor quality and inadequacy of public transport, these vehicles are also operating on major roads.\n",
      "\"They not only cause traffic jams but also contribute to road accidents. The presence of rickshaws on main roads creates speed differentials, reducing overall traffic speed.”\n",
      "“In addition, battery-operated rickshaws have speeds that do not match their structure, making them prone to risks,\" he added.\n",
      "Newaz suggested implementing measures such as restricting rickshaw access to main roads during peak hours and colour-coding rickshaws by area to improve identification and regulation.\n",
      "“A survey should be conducted to determine rickshaw routes and regulate their movement and numbers within a structured framework. The plan should also include gradual steps to eliminate rickshaws from main roads,” he said.\n",
      "“Colour-coding rickshaws by area will make it easier to identify those from other areas when they enter different zones.\"\n",
      "Dhaka Metropolitan Police Additional Commissioner (Traffic) Khandaker Nazmul Hasan, said measures are being taken again to control battery-operated rickshaws.\n",
      "He told bdews24.com on Thursday, \"We have noticed that battery-operated rickshaws are causing disorder on the roads, and in some places, they have occupied three out of four lanes.”\n",
      "“Our traffic police force is on the field, but many are new to their duties, so it is taking some time to address these issues.”\n",
      "“I only joined yesterday [Wednesday], but we hope to see visible progress within a few days.\"\n",
      "On Monday, padel rickshaw-pullers blocked the Shahbagh intersection to protest against the ban on battery-powered rickshaws.\n",
      "On the same day, battery-operated rickshaws and easy bike drivers also protested, demanding the right to operate on main roads.\n",
      "Earlier, on May 15, a decision was made to ban battery-powered rickshaws from Dhaka’s main roads.\n",
      "At that time, then-transport minister Obaidul Quader said: \"No battery-operated vehicles should operate in Dhaka city. We have banned them on 22 highways.”\n",
      "“It's not just about the ban; measures must be taken to ensure they cannot operate.\"\n",
      "In protest, rickshaw-pullers and garage owners blocked roads in Dhaka, resulting in clashes with law-enforcing agencies and several injuries.\n",
      "On May 20, former cabinet secretary Md Mahbub Hossain said the decision to ban battery-operated rickshaws had been made without informing Sheikh Hasina.\n",
      "However, the decision was later revised, allowing their operation but restricting them from main roads.\n",

      "Justice Aziz resigned a day before the highly controversial Jan 22 elections, with senior election commissioner Justice Mahfuzur Rahman taking over as acting chief election commissioner.\n",
      "Later, all five members resigned on Jan 31.\n",
      "Subsequently, a new commission led by ATM Shamsul Huda was installed on Feb 5, 2007.\n",
      "Among those appointed was Election Commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain, while former military officer M Sakhawat Hussain, currently an advisor the interim government, joined on Feb 14.\n",
      "After serving for five years, the terms of two commissioners ended on Feb 5, 2012.\n",
      "The EC did not remain vacant, as another commissioner was still in office. Sakhawat retired on Feb 14, 2012, marking the end of his five-year term.\n",
      "Since then, the EC has not been fully vacant.\n",
      "During the 2012-2017 tenure, Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Rakibuddin and four other members left office on Feb 9, 2017, while the remaining member, Md Shahnewaz, completed his term on Feb 1. During those five days, there was no decision-making work for the lone commissioner.\n",
      "After a series of dialogues and consultations, President Abdul Hamid appointed a new five-member commission, led by KM Nurul Huda, on Feb 6, 2017.\n",
      "All members assumed their responsibilities on Feb 15, serving until Feb 14, 2022.\n",
      "The next commission, led by Kazi Habibul Awal, was appointed on Feb 27, leaving the EC vacant for 12 days.\n",
      "This recent vacancy marks a similar situation, awaiting the formation of a new election commission.\n",

      "Battery-run rickshaws cause traffic chaos on return to Dhaka’s main roads\n",
      "06 Sep 2024, 01:37 AM\n",
      "Body : \n",
      "Battery-powered rickshaws and easy bikes, banned from Dhaka’s main roads, have defied restrictions over the past few days.\n",
      "Since Aug 5, these vehicles have been dominating main roads, contributing to traffic disarray with their erratic movements and use of wrong lanes.\n",
      "Drivers and passengers of other vehicles, as well as police officers, have reported increasing concerns about the disorder caused by these three-wheeled vehicles.\n",
      "During a recent visit to areas like Mirpur, Dhanmondi, Shyamoli, Mohakhali, and Badda, numerous battery-operated rickshaws and easy bikes were operating on every major road.\n",
      "These rickshaws often cut in front of faster vehicles and navigate turns unpredictably, causing confusion and increasing risks on the roads.\n",
      "Manjur Hossain, a battery-operated rickshaw-puller from Agargaon, said: “We would earlier avoid main roads during the day, but now with no police presence, we operate everywhere.”\n",
      "“Now, police don’t stop us like they used to. This is why we even take trips on major roads now. We know it’s not safe to go alongside large vehicles on big roads.”\n",
      "“But on main roads, we can get longer trips and earn a bit more,” he added.\n",
      "Another rickshaw-puller, Humayun Kabir from Badda, said: “If CNG drivers can use the main roads, why can not we? They drive engine vehicles, and so do we.”\n",
      "Nazmul Hossain, a CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver, told bdnews24.com that the traffic police have become less active since Aug 5, allowing battery-powered rickshaws to operate freely.\n",
      "“Police don’t enforce the rules like they used to, so these rickshaws are all over the main roads now. They drive recklessly, which only adds to the traffic congestion,” he said.\n",
      "Another CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver, Ahmed Ali, told bdnews24.com: “They drive very fast and make sudden turns without signalling.”\n",
      "“It’s very difficult for drivers behind them to anticipate their movements, increasing the risk of accidents,” he explained.\n",
      "Bulbul Ahmed, a resident of Mirpur, said: “At one time, battery-operated rickshaws were fined and dumped for running on the main road. Now, these practices have stopped.”\n",
      "“The lack of traffic police makes it difficult to control their movement.”\n",
      "Mohammadpur resident Alif Khan told bdnews24.com the presence of battery-operated rickshaws on Dhaka's main roads is extremely dangerous.\n",
      "Alif Khan from Mohammadpur described the situation as dangerous due to the absence of proper indicators on rickshaws, which makes it hard for other drivers to anticipate their movements.\n",
      "“These rickshaws move at speeds of 30 to 35 kilometres per hour, causing other vehicles to slow down and contributing to traffic jams,” he said.\n",
      "A traffic policeman on duty in Shyamoli told bdnews24.com:\"Currently, no one listens to anyone, and the situation is chaotic everywhere. Auto-rickshaws have taken over the streets, driving recklessly. “\n",
      "“Our force is also reduced, so we can't enforce the rules or take action against them. It's not just this road; there is no road in Dhaka where these rickshaws aren't present.\"\n",
      "Khalequzzaman Lipon, central convenor of the Rickshaw, Battery Rickshaw, Van, and Easy Bike Sangram Parishad told bdnews24.com that their organisation has advised drivers to avoid main roads.\n",
      "However, he urged the traffic police to be more active.\n",
      "\"Our directive was to operate only on roads other than the main ones. We have already informed various areas and sent letters through our associations,” said Lipon.\n",
      "“However, the traffic police are not enforcing any restrictions on the roads, leading to this indiscipline,” he added.\n",
      "Kazi Md Saifun Newaz, an assistant professor at Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology, or BUET, told bdnews24.com that rickshaws are a popular mode of transport for Dhaka residents, both for commuting to work and other locations.\n",
      "However, due to the poor quality and inadequacy of public transport, these vehicles are also operating on major roads.\n",
      "\"They not only cause traffic jams but also contribute to road accidents. The presence of rickshaws on main roads creates speed differentials, reducing overall traffic speed.”\n",
      "“In addition, battery-operated rickshaws have speeds that do not match their structure, making them prone to risks,\" he added.\n",
      "Newaz suggested implementing measures such as restricting rickshaw access to main roads during peak hours and colour-coding rickshaws by area to improve identification and regulation.\n",
      "“A survey should be conducted to determine rickshaw routes and regulate their movement and numbers within a structured framework. The plan should also include gradual steps to eliminate rickshaws from main roads,” he said.\n",
      "“Colour-coding rickshaws by area will make it easier to identify those from other areas when they enter different zones.\"\n",
      "Dhaka Metropolitan Police Additional Commissioner (Traffic) Khandaker Nazmul Hasan, said measures are being taken again to control battery-operated rickshaws.\n",
      "He told bdews24.com on Thursday, \"We have noticed that battery-operated rickshaws are causing disorder on the roads, and in some places, they have occupied three out of four lanes.”\n",
      "“Our traffic police force is on the field, but many are new to their duties, so it is taking some time to address these issues.”\n",
      "“I only joined yesterday [Wednesday], but we hope to see visible progress within a few days.\"\n",
      "On Monday, padel rickshaw-pullers blocked the Shahbagh intersection to protest against the ban on battery-powered rickshaws.\n",
      "On the same day, battery-operated rickshaws and easy bike drivers also protested, demanding the right to operate on main roads.\n",
      "Earlier, on May 15, a decision was made to ban battery-powered rickshaws from Dhaka’s main roads.\n",
      "At that time, then-transport minister Obaidul Quader said: \"No battery-operated vehicles should operate in Dhaka city. We have banned them on 22 highways.”\n",
      "“It's not just about the ban; measures must be taken to ensure they cannot operate.\"\n",
      "In protest, rickshaw-pullers and garage owners blocked roads in Dhaka, resulting in clashes with law-enforcing agencies and several injuries.\n",
      "On May 20, former cabinet secretary Md Mahbub Hossain said the decision to ban battery-operated rickshaws had been made without informing Sheikh Hasina.\n",
      "However, the decision was later revised, allowing their operation but restricting them from main roads.\n",

       " 'body': ['Bangladesh’s interim government will ‘work with’ India in order to resolve the issues over the long-pending Teesta water-sharing treaty, says Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus.\\nThe issue has been left hanging for an extended period, which is not good for either country, he told Indian news organisation PTI in an interview.\\nYunus spoke with PTI from his official residence in Dhaka. Many Indian outlets published reports based on the interview on Friday.\\nThe chief advisor urged the issue to be resolved according to international norms.\\n“By sitting over this issue [water sharing], it is not serving any purpose. If I know how much water I will get, even if I am not happy and sign it, it would be better. This issue has to be resolved,” he said.\\nAsked whether the interim government would push India on the issue, he said:\\n“Push is a big word; I am not saying it. We will pursue it. But we have to sit together and resolve it,” he told PTI.\\nThe much-anticipated agreement on the Teesta water was supposed to happen during the visit of then Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh to Dhaka in September 2011. In the lead-up to that visit, the water resource ministers of both countries had agreed on a sharing deal.\\nHowever, the treaty was stalled due to opposition from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. This deadlock has not been resolved even after 13 years.\\nAlthough there were hopes for the Teesta agreement after Narendra Modi\\'s BJP government came to power, Mamata\\'s stance did not change.\\nThis year, following a trip to India by then prime minister Sheikh Hasina, the premiers of the two countries made a statement saying that India had decided to begin technical discussions of renewing the 1996 Ganges water-sharing treaty. The statement added that a technical team from India would also be dispatched to Bangladesh to discuss the conservation and management of the Teesta River.\\n“This is not a new issue but a very old issue. We have spoken on this issue on several occasions. The discussions began during the period of Pakistan\\'s rule. While we all wanted this treaty to be finalised, even the Indian government was ready for it. However, the state government of West Bengal was not ready for it. We need to resolve it,” Yunus told PTI.\\n“We have to resolve this issue according to international norms. The lower riparian countries have certain rights, and we want those rights,” he said.\\nYunus’s remarks come after Syeda Rizwana Hasan, the interim government advisor on water resources, told PTI that Dhaka would push to restart dialogue with Delhi on the treaty.\\nYunus also spoke about the recent flooding in Bangladesh and reports from Dhaka blaming India for the floods. Until a treaty is signed on the matter, he urges a humanitarian approach.\\n“When the High Commissioner [of India] came to meet me, I said that we can work on better management to see how the situation can be controlled during the floods. For such coordination between two countries, we don’t need any treaty.\"\\n\"We can work on this together on humanitarian grounds and resolve this, as this will ease the suffering of the masses. Such humanitarian steps would really help,” he said.\\nThe chief advisor also condemned the issue of border killings between the two countries, describing the killings of Bangladeshi citizens by Indian border forces as ‘callousness’.\\n“Killing someone is not a solution, as there are legal ways to deal with this. There has to be a ground mechanism and legal procedure to handle it. This is a one-sided thing. No one is crossing the border to capture your country; those who are being killed by shooting are just couriers. This is callousness. This has to stop,” he said.',\n",
       "  'Youth Advisor Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain has said the people of Bangladesh will decide whether the Awami League and its political allies, accused of committing ‘genocide’, can re-enter politics before their trial.\\nThe government, born from a student-led popular uprising, believes there is no room for rehabilitation until justice is served, he said after an advisory council meeting on Thursday.\\nWhile discussing the prosecution of the Awami League, he mentioned the absence of specific laws for party-level trials and said the law ministry is working to ensure their prosecution for crimes against humanity.\\n“The question of whether a fascist political party and its allies, who had established fascism in Bangladesh, should return to politics will be left to the people until their full trial is completed,\" he said.\\n\"We are considering how to implement measures against their public activities, but there is no final decision yet. However, we will strongly discourage such activities,\" he added.\\nWhen asked about the absence of laws to prosecute political parties, he said: \"No decision has been made regarding the trial of any party. The matter is under the law ministry, which will soon present a clear plan.\"\\nHe said the decision on how the Awami League will be prosecuted lies with the public.\\n\"Given that the Awami League committed genocide in this country, it is up to the people to decide how they return or whether they should be allowed to return.\"\\nOn Aug 5, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled to India amid mass protests and public anger.\\nShortly after her departure, the Ganabhaban, her official residence, was ransacked and looted by an enraged public, with everything in and around the premises being destroyed.\\nIn response to a question about turning Ganabhaban into the July Revolution Memorial Museum, advisor Asif said: “This has been done in many places around the world, including South Korea. We will draw from those experiences to create a proper museum that preserves the memory of our martyrs and the atrocities of the fascist era. Visible steps will be taken swiftly in this regard. The Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will jointly carry out this task.”',\n",
       "  'The interim government\\'s advisory council has decided to transform Ganabhaban, a building surrounded by greenery in the bustling city of Dhaka, into a ‘July Revolution Memorial Museum\\'.\\nGanabhaban was the palatial residence of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, located on the northern side of parliament building.\\nOn Aug 5, Hasina fled to India in the face of a mass uprising. Later, the building was looted by agitated protesters.\\nAfter the advisory council\\'s meeting on Thursday, Youth and Sports Advisor Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuyain told reporters about the caretaker administration’s decision to convert Ganabhaban into a memorial museum.\\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s daughters Hasina and Sheikh Rehana had been staying there following the “Father of the Nation Security of Family Members Act, 2009 (Act No. 63 of 2009)\".\\nAfter being sworn in as prime minister in 2009, Hasina moved into the Ganabhaban with her family in 2010.\\nShe was the only prime minister to have lived in the Ganabhaban. It was initially built as the office of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during his tenure.\\nWhile speaking to reporters, the sports advisor also said although Ganabhaban’s ‘Gana’ means ‘people,’ the building could never become the ‘peoples building’ like the name suggests.\\n“The people of this country, the students, have won it [Ganabhaban] through a coup d\\'état. The building will be open to the public.\"\\n\"Ganabhaban will be established as the \\'July Revolution Memorial Museum\\' to preserve the memory of the martyrs and all the injustices committed by the previous fascist government.\\n\"The work will start very soon. It [Ganabhaban] will be kept in the same condition as it has been since the victory. A museum will be set up inside so that the memory of the coup is preserved,” he added.\\nOn Aug 29, the interim government decided to scrap the law that ensures the additional security for the family members of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman considering it a ‘discriminatory policy.’\\nThe \"Father of the Nation Security of Family Members Act, 2009 (Act No. 63 of 2009)\" was passed after the Awami League formed the government in the ninth general election following a landslide victory.\\nUnder the law, a special security facility was ensured for the living members of the Father of the Nation’s family.\\nThe law had provisions for safe residence and other necessary benefits for each family member. A gazette was issued in May 2015 to provide special security and facilities as per the law.\\nEarlier in 2001, the Awami League government passed the \"Father of the Nation Security of Family Members Act-2001” just before they stepped down. But the BNP-led Four Party Alliance government nullified the act during the eighth parliament.',\n",
       "  'Battery-powered rickshaws and easy bikes, banned from Dhaka’s main roads, have defied restrictions over the past few days.\\nSince Aug 5, these vehicles have been dominating main roads, contributing to traffic disarray with their erratic movements and use of wrong lanes.\\nDrivers and passengers of other vehicles, as well as police officers, have reported increasing concerns about the disorder caused by these three-wheeled vehicles.\\nDuring a recent visit to areas like Mirpur, Dhanmondi, Shyamoli, Mohakhali, and Badda, numerous battery-operated rickshaws and easy bikes were operating on every major road.\\nThese rickshaws often cut in front of faster vehicles and navigate turns unpredictably, causing confusion and increasing risks on the roads.\\nManjur Hossain, a battery-operated rickshaw-puller from Agargaon, said: “We would earlier avoid main roads during the day, but now with no police presence, we operate everywhere.”\\n“Now, police don’t stop us like they used to. This is why we even take trips on major roads now. We know it’s not safe to go alongside large vehicles on big roads.”\\n“But on main roads, we can get longer trips and earn a bit more,” he added.\\nAnother rickshaw-puller, Humayun Kabir from Badda, said: “If CNG drivers can use the main roads, why can not we? They drive engine vehicles, and so do we.”\\nNazmul Hossain, a CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver, told bdnews24.com that the traffic police have become less active since Aug 5, allowing battery-powered rickshaws to operate freely.\\n“Police don’t enforce the rules like they used to, so these rickshaws are all over the main roads now. They drive recklessly, which only adds to the traffic congestion,” he said.\\nAnother CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver, Ahmed Ali, told bdnews24.com: “They drive very fast and make sudden turns without signalling.”\\n“It’s very difficult for drivers behind them to anticipate their movements, increasing the risk of accidents,” he explained.\\nBulbul Ahmed, a resident of Mirpur, said: “At one time, battery-operated rickshaws were fined and dumped for running on the main road. Now, these practices have stopped.”\\n“The lack of traffic police makes it difficult to control their movement.”\\nMohammadpur resident Alif Khan told bdnews24.com the presence of battery-operated rickshaws on Dhaka\\'s main roads is extremely dangerous.\\nAlif Khan from Mohammadpur described the situation as dangerous due to the absence of proper indicators on rickshaws, which makes it hard for other drivers to anticipate their movements.\\n“These rickshaws move at speeds of 30 to 35 kilometres per hour, causing other vehicles to slow down and contributing to traffic jams,” he said.\\nA traffic policeman on duty in Shyamoli told bdnews24.com:\"Currently, no one listens to anyone, and the situation is chaotic everywhere. Auto-rickshaws have taken over the streets, driving recklessly. “\\n“Our force is also reduced, so we can\\'t enforce the rules or take action against them. It\\'s not just this road; there is no road in Dhaka where these rickshaws aren\\'t present.\"\\nKhalequzzaman Lipon, central convenor of the Rickshaw, Battery Rickshaw, Van, and Easy Bike Sangram Parishad told bdnews24.com that their organisation has advised drivers to avoid main roads.\\nHowever, he urged the traffic police to be more active.\\n\"Our directive was to operate only on roads other than the main ones. We have already informed various areas and sent letters through our associations,” said Lipon.\\n“However, the traffic police are not enforcing any restrictions on the roads, leading to this indiscipline,” he added.\\nKazi Md Saifun Newaz, an assistant professor at Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology, or BUET, told bdnews24.com that rickshaws are a popular mode of transport for Dhaka residents, both for commuting to work and other locations.\\nHowever, due to the poor quality and inadequacy of public transport, these vehicles are also operating on major roads.\\n\"They not only cause traffic jams but also contribute to road accidents. The presence of rickshaws on main roads creates speed differentials, reducing overall traffic speed.”\\n“In addition, battery-operated rickshaws have speeds that do not match their structure, making them prone to risks,\" he added.\\nNewaz suggested implementing measures such as restricting rickshaw access to main roads during peak hours and colour-coding rickshaws by area to improve identification and regulation.\\n“A survey should be conducted to determine rickshaw routes and regulate their movement and numbers within a structured framework. The plan should also include gradual steps to eliminate rickshaws from main roads,” he said.\\n“Colour-coding rickshaws by area will make it easier to identify those from other areas when they enter different zones.\"\\nDhaka Metropolitan Police Additional Commissioner (Traffic) Khandaker Nazmul Hasan, said measures are being taken again to control battery-operated rickshaws.\\nHe told bdews24.com on Thursday, \"We have noticed that battery-operated rickshaws are causing disorder on the roads, and in some places, they have occupied three out of four lanes.”\\n“Our traffic police force is on the field, but many are new to their duties, so it is taking some time to address these issues.”\\n“I only joined yesterday [Wednesday], but we hope to see visible progress within a few days.\"\\nOn Monday, padel rickshaw-pullers blocked the Shahbagh intersection to protest against the ban on battery-powered rickshaws.\\nOn the same day, battery-operated rickshaws and easy bike drivers also protested, demanding the right to operate on main roads.\\nEarlier, on May 15, a decision was made to ban battery-powered rickshaws from Dhaka’s main roads.\\nAt that time, then-transport minister Obaidul Quader said: \"No battery-operated vehicles should operate in Dhaka city. We have banned them on 22 highways.”\\n“It\\'s not just about the ban; measures must be taken to ensure they cannot operate.\"\\nIn protest, rickshaw-pullers and garage owners blocked roads in Dhaka, resulting in clashes with law-enforcing agencies and several injuries.\\nOn May 20, former cabinet secretary Md Mahbub Hossain said the decision to ban battery-operated rickshaws had been made without informing Sheikh Hasina.\\nHowever, the decision was later revised, allowing their operation but restricting them from main roads.\\n[Writing in English by Sheikh Fariha Bristy]',\n",

       "  'Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus has sent a message to the nation on the one-month anniversary of the fall of the Awami League government in the face of a mass uprising in Bangladesh.\\n\"I am committed to fulfilling the dream that our young revolutionaries have instilled into the minds of the people of our country to build a new Bangladesh. The sacrifices of the martyrs have inspired us to change the course of history. We want to begin a new era.\"\\nAfter former prime minister Sheikh Hasina tendered her resignation on Aug 5, an interim government led by Yunus took office on Aug 8.\\nHe added: \"We take a pledge - we will not let the blood shed by the martyrs and the sacrifice of the injured brothers and sisters go in vain. We will never let go of the opportunity they have given us.”\\n\"Today, in their remembrance, I once again pledge that we will build a new Bangladesh of their dreams.\"\\nYunus’s message read:\\nAssalamu Alaikum\\nToday we are celebrating the first month of the second independence of Bangladesh. Hundreds of students and people from all walks of life made a supreme sacrifice for one of the most glorious revolutions in history.\\nThey ended the 15-year dictatorship of the fascist Sheikh Hasina, who led a brutal genocide. Sheikh Hasina fled the country leaving behind a corrupt state and a fragile economy. It is our responsibility to establish Bangladesh in its full glory.\\nToday, I am remembering the brave youth, workers, day labourers, and professionals who died while resisting the murderous fascist forces. I am remembering the journalists who were killed during the movement. I pay my deepest respect to all those who were martyred in this revolution.\\nI also salute the thousands of people who have been injured, crippled after sustaining life-threatening injuries, or lost their eyesight.\\nLast month, when I was appointed to lead the interim government, I took over the responsibility despite my limitations, inspired by Abu Sayeed, Mugdho and the selfless sacrifice of all the known and unknown martyrs.\\nI am committed to fulfilling the dream that our young revolutionaries have instilled in the minds of the people of the country to build a new Bangladesh. The sacrifices of the martyrs have inspired us to change the course of history. We want to begin a new era.\\nMore to follow.'],\n",

      "06 Sep 2024, 01:32 AM\n",
      "Body : \n",
      "The Election Commission has fallen vacant once again following the resignation of Kazi Habibul Awal and his team appointed during Sheikh Hasina's tenure.\n",
      "The incumbent commissioners stood down on Thursday, just a month after the Hasina government was brought down by pro-democracy demonstrators, leaving the posts empty until the establishment of a new commission.\n",
      "The elections regulator was halfway through its five-year term.\n",
      "This is not the first time the EC has been left vacant, though.\n",
      "In 2007, under Justice MA Aziz, the six-strong commission was vacant for a week after all members resigned.\n",
      "Justice Aziz resigned a day before the highly controversial Jan 22 elections, with senior election commissioner Justice Mahfuzur Rahman taking over as acting chief election commissioner.\n",
      "Later, all five members resigned on Jan 31.\n",
      "Subsequently, a new commission led by ATM Shamsul Huda was installed on Feb 5, 2007.\n",
      "Among those appointed was Election Commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain, while former military officer M Sakhawat Hussain, currently an advisor the interim government, joined on Feb 14.\n",
      "After serving for five years, the terms of two commissioners ended on Feb 5, 2012.\n",
      "The EC did not remain vacant, as another commissioner was still in office. Sakhawat retired on Feb 14, 2012, marking the end of his five-year term.\n",
      "Since then, the EC has not been fully vacant.\n",
      "During the 2012-2017 tenure, Chief Election Commissioner Kazi Rakibuddin and four other members left office on Feb 9, 2017, while the remaining member, Md Shahnewaz, completed his term on Feb 1. During those five days, there was no decision-making work for the lone commissioner.\n",
      "After a series of dialogues and consultations, President Abdul Hamid appointed a new five-member commission, led by KM Nurul Huda, on Feb 6, 2017.\n",
      "All members assumed their responsibilities on Feb 15, serving until Feb 14, 2022.\n",
      "The next commission, led by Kazi Habibul Awal, was appointed on Feb 27, leaving the EC vacant for 12 days.\n",
      "This recent vacancy marks a similar situation, awaiting the formation of a new election commission.\n",

      "Bangladesh wants to resolve Teesta water-sharing issues while following international rules: Yunus\n",
      "06 Sep 2024, 04:38 PM\n",
      "Body : \n",
      "Bangladesh’s interim government will ‘work with’ India in order to resolve the issues over the long-pending Teesta water-sharing treaty, says Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus.\n",
      "The issue has been left hanging for an extended period, which is not good for either country, he told Indian news organisation PTI in an interview.\n",
      "Yunus spoke with PTI from his official residence in Dhaka. Many Indian outlets published reports based on the interview on Friday.\n",
      "The chief advisor urged the issue to be resolved according to international norms.\n",
      "“By sitting over this issue [water sharing], it is not serving any purpose. If I know how much water I will get, even if I am not happy and sign it, it would be better. This issue has to be resolved,” he said.\n",
      "Asked whether the interim government would push India on the issue, he said:\n",
      "“Push is a big word; I am not saying it. We will pursue it. But we have to sit together and resolve it,” he told PTI.\n",
      "The much-anticipated agreement on the Teesta water was supposed to happen during the visit of then Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh to Dhaka in September 2011. In the lead-up to that visit, the water resource ministers of both countries had agreed on a sharing deal.\n",
      "However, the treaty was stalled due to opposition from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. This deadlock has not been resolved even after 13 years.\n",
      "Although there were hopes for the Teesta agreement after Narendra Modi's BJP government came to power, Mamata's stance did not change.\n",
      "This year, following a trip to India by then prime minister Sheikh Hasina, the premiers of the two countries made a statement saying that India had decided to begin technical discussions of renewing the 1996 Ganges water-sharing treaty. The statement added that a technical team from India would also be dispatched to Bangladesh to discuss the conservation and management of the Teesta River.\n",
      "“This is not a new issue but a very old issue. We have spoken on this issue on several occasions. The discussions began during the period of Pakistan's rule. While we all wanted this treaty to be finalised, even the Indian government was ready for it. However, the state government of West Bengal was not ready for it. We need to resolve it,” Yunus told PTI.\n",
      "“We have to resolve this issue according to international norms. The lower riparian countries have certain rights, and we want those rights,” he said.\n",
      "Yunus’s remarks come after Syeda Rizwana Hasan, the interim government advisor on water resources, told PTI that Dhaka would push to restart dialogue with Delhi on the treaty.\n",
      "Yunus also spoke about the recent flooding in Bangladesh and reports from Dhaka blaming India for the floods. Until a treaty is signed on the matter, he urges a humanitarian approach.\n",
      "“When the High Commissioner [of India] came to meet me, I said that we can work on better management to see how the situation can be controlled during the floods. For such coordination between two countries, we don’t need any treaty.\"\n",
      "\"We can work on this together on humanitarian grounds and resolve this, as this will ease the suffering of the masses. Such humanitarian steps would really help,” he said.\n",
      "The chief advisor also condemned the issue of border killings between the two countries, describing the killings of Bangladeshi citizens by Indian border forces as ‘callousness’.\n",
      "“Killing someone is not a solution, as there are legal ways to deal with this. There has to be a ground mechanism and legal procedure to handle it. This is a one-sided thing. No one is crossing the border to capture your country; those who are being killed by shooting are just couriers. This is callousness. This has to stop,” he said.\n",
